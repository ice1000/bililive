# intellij-bililive

This plugin is compatible with IntelliJ-based IDE starting from 2020.1,
and I have no plan to support earlier versions, even it's potentially compatible with 'em.

Speical syntax support: danmaku starting from `!!` will create an IDE popup.

Example taken from Lexburner's live:
